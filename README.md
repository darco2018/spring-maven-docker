# POC for Maven + Springboot + Docker in 2 versions

1. Simple - just put Dockerfile & pom.xml from **dockerfile-simple** folder in the **root folder** of the project.
2. Advanced(takes advantage of the clean separation between dependencies and application resources in a Spring Boot fat jar file) - just put Dockerfile & pom.xml from **dockerfile-advanced** folder in the **root folder** of the project
